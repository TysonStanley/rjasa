Required elements of the above `yaml` are:

* `title`: Title
* `runningtitle`: Author last names, use _et al._ if there are three or more authors.
* `author`: List of author(s) containing `name` and `num`
* `corrauth`: Corresponding author's name and address.
* `email`: Correspondence email
* `abstract`: Limited to 200 words
* `bibliography`: BibTeX `.bib` file
* `bibliographystyle`: jasaauthyear2 or jasanum2

All of the rest of the document is just like regular RMarkdown syntax (with the occassional use of \LaTex code).

  Put your abstract here. Abstracts are limited to 100 words for JASA-EL articles. Please no personal pronouns, also please do not use the words “new” and/or “novel” in the abstract. An article usually includes an abstract, a concise summary of the work covered at length in the main body of the article.

# Background on the Template {-}

This template provides the formatting for a JASA-EL submission. Required elements of the above `yaml` are:

* `title`: Title
* `runningtitle`: The running head (a short version of the title)
* `author`: List of author(s) containing `name` (full names), `affil` (the affiliation of each author), and a single `corr` for the corresponding author
* `email`: Correspondence email
* `abstract`: Limited to 100 words
* `bibliography`: BibTeX `.bib` file
* `bibliographystyle`: jasaauthyear2 (full author citation) or jasanum2 (citations as numbers)
  
\noindent All of the rest of the document is just like regular RMarkdown syntax (with the occassional use of \LaTeX code). Some other notable things that JASA-EL requires:

1. Acknowledgments after the text of the article but before footnotes and references.
2. Textual footnotes (allowed only if the paper cites references by author name and year of publication).
3. References (if the paper cites references by labeling them with numbers according to the order in which they appear, this section will also include textual footnotes).
4. Tables, each on a separate page, and each with a caption that is placed above the table.
5. Collected figure captions.
6. If the manuscript is submitted in PDF form, the final pages of the uploaded manuscript can include the figures, each on a separate page, and each in PDF format. However, each figure must be submitted in a separate file as described in 6.2 below.
7. Figures can be in TIFF, EPS, PS, or JPEG format.

Feel free to erase all of this background section at any point :)

# Introduction

Start your document here, briefly introducing the topic at hand. JASA recommends: "The length of a JASA-EL paper is restricted to six pages in the final format. (This is approximately equivalent to a four-page article in the Journal of the Acoustical Society of America.) To calculate a rough estimate of the published length of a manuscript, add one-half of the number of manuscript pages and one-half of the number of figures."

# Methods

Report all the methods so someone could completely reproduce the results.

# Results

Provide the results, clearly and concisely. Can include tables and figures here, within the constraints of the page limits for JASA-EL.

# Discussion

The discussion of the results goes here, incorporating the results into the broader literature.

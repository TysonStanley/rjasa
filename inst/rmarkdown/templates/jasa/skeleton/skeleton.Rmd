# Background on the Template {-}

This template provides the formatting for a JASA submission. Required elements of the above `yaml` are:

* `title`: Title
* `runningtitle`: The running head (a short version of the title)
* `author`: List of author(s) containing `name` (full names), `affil` (the affiliation of each author), and a single `email` for the corresponding author
* 
* `abstract`: Limited to 100 words
* `bibliography`: BibTeX `.bib` file
* `bibliographystyle`: jasaauthyear2 (full author citation) or jasanum2 (citations as numbers)

\noindent The `classoption` can be `preprint` or `reprint` and can be used to control citation type with `NumberedRefs` or if the lines are numbered with `TurnOnLineNumbers`. All of the rest of the document is just like regular RMarkdown syntax (with the occassional use of \LaTeX code). Some other notable things that JASA-EL requires:

1. Acknowledgments after the text of the article but before footnotes and references.
2. Textual footnotes (allowed only if the paper cites references by author name and year of publication).
3. References (if the paper cites references by labeling them with numbers according to the order in which they appear, this section will also include textual footnotes).
4. Tables, each on a separate page, and each with a caption that is placed above the table. (Use `\begin{ruledtabular}...\end{ruledtabular}` to spread the table
out to the width of the column or page, and to add two lines at the top and bottom of the table. This is generally helpful, but multicolumn doesn't work well in the `ruledtabular` environment. If you need to use the `\multicolumn` command you should not use `ruledtabular`, but instead type in `\hline\hline... table...\hline\hline`
so that there are still two lines at the top and bottom of the table.)
5. Collected figure captions.
6. If the manuscript is submitted in PDF form, the final pages of the uploaded manuscript can include the figures, each on a separate page, and each in PDF format. However, each figure must be submitted in a separate file as described in 6.2 below.
7. Figures can be in TIFF, EPS, PS, or JPEG format.
